<analysis>Analyzing the tracker for the Hello World App project. This is the simplest possible application; it should only render the text "Hello, World!" centered on the screen.</analysis>

I'll generate a functional component that returns the text "Hello, World!" wrapped in a `div` for basic styling, with Tailwind classes for centering.</reasoning>
